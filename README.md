# RBS-Signage-Beautifier
### A browser extension to overhaul the default digital signage pages of the TES Room Booking System

## Introduction
Salutations, my unacquainted friend!
This little extension was made while I was fairly early in the process of learning HTML, CSS and Javascript - so bugs and room for improvement should be expected.
#### Feedback, criticism, suggestions and feature requests are entirely welcome and genuinely appreciated.

## Purpose
At the time of writing, I'm currently working as a support technician for a SEND[^1] academy, which uses the Room Booking System for all their facility bookings. This includes everything from cameras and laptops to office spaces and minibuses. Functionally, the Room Booking System works fine for the most part. It does what it says on the tin, and most importantly, it's a free service provided as part of a larger package. Where it fails, however, is with its built-in digital signage.

#### Take a look at this example screenshot from the default digital signage links:

Bland, unreadable, and uninformative. As if the stunted aesthetic wasn't bad enough, it doesn't even show the bookings without having to manually hover over each cell. It's completely useless for a digital display, which is what the feature is meant to provide.

#### Now, here's the exact same page, but loaded with this extension enabled:

I'll let you come to your own conclusion on the aesthetics, but the constrast between the two screenshots is stark. The table actually stretches properly to take advantage of the screen's resolution, the irrelevant weekend days with booking disabled have been automatically detected and removed from the display, and most importantly, the actual bookings are now visible and neatly organised onto packed cards within their timeslot.
